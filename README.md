#  Flight Price & Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing flight pricing data to identify key revenue drivers and business opportunities in the airline industry.  
Python was used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), extract pricing insights, and support data-driven revenue optimization strategies.

The analysis covers ticket prices, airlines, travel classes, routes, departure times, and number of stops, followed by actionable business recommendations.

##  Key Analysis Areas
- Average price by class and airline
- Peak vs off-peak demand analysis
- Pricing impact of departure time and arrival period
- Route-based analysis (business corridors)
- Stops vs price relationship
- Multivariate analysis (Class × Time)

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Business Class is the primary revenue driver despite lower ticket volume.
- Morning and Evening flights have higher average prices due to peak demand.
- Premium airlines maintain higher prices through brand positioning.
- Non-stop flights are priced significantly higher than connecting flights.
- Metro-to-metro routes represent strong business travel demand.

---

##  Revenue Optimization Recommendations
- Implement dynamic pricing based on demand and time.
- Expand and promote Business Class offerings on high-demand routes.
- Apply premium pricing during peak departure times.
- Use upselling and bundling strategies to increase average ticket value.
- Position non-stop flights as premium convenience options.
- Leverage strong airline brands to avoid price competition.
